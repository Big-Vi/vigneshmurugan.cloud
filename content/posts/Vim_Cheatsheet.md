Vim is a very powerful text editor and can be configured to use as IDE.

Learning vim has a steep learning curve. Try replacing your regular IDE with vim or work with it side by side. Slowly you can figure out how to do basic actions you do in IDE with vim such as copy, paste, select, tab, split and more. 

Create your own cheat sheet & that would be the go-to place to reference it later.

I've shared mine below with the [vim configuration link](https://gist.github.com/Big-Vi/673b11c8976d6590dd0944651f2b6e51).
