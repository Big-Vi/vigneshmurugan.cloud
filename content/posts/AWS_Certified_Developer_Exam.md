While AWS recommends the Certified Developer - Associate exam for those with at least a year of hands-on experience, I believe success depends more on dedicated preparation. I decided to pursue this certification not just for the accreditation but for the structured learning path it provides.

Even without prior AWS knowledge, I was able to pass by dedicating a consistent amount of time each day over three to six months. This post outlines the resources I used and the lessons I learned along the way.

## My Study Strategy and Resources

A quick search for "how to prepare for the certified developer exam" will yield countless resources. After some research, I settled on a core set of materials that proved invaluable.

### Key Resources:

-   **Udemy Course**: [Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/) by Stephane Maarek. This was my primary learning resource.
-   **Practice Exams**: [Practice Exams for DVA-C01](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01/) also by Stephane Maarek.
-   **Official AWS Documentation**: Essential for deep dives into specific services.
-   **Hands-on Labs**: Applying theoretical knowledge in the AWS console is crucial.

## The Importance of Practice Exams

The AWS Developer exam covers a vast number of topics, and retaining all that information is a major challenge. The single most effective way I found to solidify my knowledge was by taking practice exams repeatedly. The Udemy course I used included six full practice tests that were critical for simulating real exam scenarios.

> **My Exam Tip:** Don't just take the tests. After each one, meticulously review every answerâ€”both the ones you got right and the ones you got wrong. The explanations often include links to the official AWS documentation, which are perfect for filling knowledge gaps. Identify your weak areas and study the relevant docs before attempting the next practice test.

## Tips for Taking the Online Exam

You can take the exam either in person or online through services like PSI or Pearson VUE. With no testing centers in my location, I opted for an online exam with PSI.

A crucial lesson I learned was to prepare your testing environment well in advance. The proctoring software is sensitive and will flag applications like VPNs, virtualization tools (VMware), or device management clients (JumpCloud).

I learned this the hard way. I had planned to use my work computer and had run the pre-exam system check without any issues. However, on exam day, the PSI Bridge software required me to shut down the JumpCloud agent. As I didn't have admin permissions to do so, I had to quickly switch to an old personal laptop, which added unnecessary stress right before the exam.

> **My Logistics Tip:** A week before your exam, decide which computer you will use. Run the official system compatibility check and, more importantly, do a full practice run by closing any background applications that might be flagged by the proctoring software. A smooth start on exam day makes a world of difference.

## Final Thoughts

While preparing for any certification can be stressful, I highly recommend the AWS Certified Developer exam. It provides a clear roadmap for learning and significantly broadens your practical knowledge of AWS services.

For me, the process was transformative. It gave me the confidence to implement solutions at work more effectively and speak about AWS architecture with authority. As a small token of that accomplishment, I'm proud to share my [AWS Badge here](https://www.credly.com/badges/b0051c96-1c01-4ac3-a2a6-49400454c7a7/public_url).
